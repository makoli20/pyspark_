#Data Description

This means that during the hour beginning at 3pm (hour 15), on September 10th, 2012, 11 people opened the Uber app (Eyeballs). 2 of them did not see any car (Zeroes) and 2 of them requested a car (Requests). Of the 2 requests, only 1 complete trips actually resulted (Completed Trips). During this time, there were a total of 7 drivers who logged in (Unique Drivers).

Using the provided dataset, answer the following questions:

- ⚡ Which date had the most completed trips during the two week period?
- ⚡ What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24 hour period?
- ⚡ Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two week period?
- ⚡ What percentages of all zeroes during the two week period occurred on weekend (Friday at 5 pm to Sunday at 3 am)?
- ⚡ What is the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver during the two week period? 
- ⚡ In drafting a driver schedule in terms of 8 hours shifts, when are the busiest 8 consecutive hours over the two week period in terms of unique requests? A new shift starts in every 8 hours. Assume that a driver will work same shift each day.
- ⚡ If you could add 5 drivers to any single hour of every day during the two week period, which hour should you add them to? 
- ⚡ Looking at the data from all two weeks, which time might make the most sense to consider a true "end day" instead of midnight? (i.e when are supply and demand at both their natural minimums)
